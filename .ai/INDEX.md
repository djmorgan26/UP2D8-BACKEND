## 🎯 Current Focus

**Phase**: Active development of UP2D8 backend API

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/capture` to document existing features (chat API, user management, etc.)
2. Continue enhancing API functionality
3. Improve test coverage and monitoring
4. Document architectural patterns as they emerge

**Active Work**: Maintaining and expanding FastAPI backend with Azure Key Vault integration

## 💡 How to Use This Index

**Every session, start here:**

1. **Check Recent Changes** (above) - See what's new since your last session
2. **Review Current Focus** - Understand what we're working on
3. **Use Quick Navigation** - Jump to relevant knowledge
4. **Read GUIDE.md** if you need help finding something specific

**After building something:**

1. Run `/capture` to automatically update this index
2. New knowledge files will be created/updated
3. Recent Changes section will be updated
4. Knowledge counts will increment

**This file is your dashboard** - it tells you everything that's happened and where to find what you need.

## 📈 System Growth

This knowledge base is actively growing with the UP2D8 backend:

- **Now**: ✅ Core features documented (Chat API, User Management, Feedback/Analytics)
- **Week 1**: Continue documenting remaining features (Articles, RSS Feeds)
- **Month 1**: All components and patterns documented, architectural decisions captured
- **Month 3**: Comprehensive knowledge base covering all API endpoints and integration patterns

**The system captures your work as you build.**

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

- **Check this file first** every session to see what's new
- **Run `/capture` regularly** to keep knowledge current
- **Use GUIDE.md** when you don't know where to look
- **Follow existing patterns** once they're documented
- **Update Recent Changes** whenever significant work is done
